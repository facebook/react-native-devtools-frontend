# rn-chrome-devtools-frontend

Source code for React Native's debugger frontend, based on Chrome DevTools. This project is periodically compiled and checked into the React Native repo as [`@react-native/debugger-frontend`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/main/packages/debugger-frontend).

This project provides the source code for React Native's debugging frontend, which is based on Chrome DevTools. It 
enables developers working on React Native apps to debug their code more efficiently by leveraging Chrome DevTools functionality.

This repository is a fork of [ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend).

##Example usage
After building the project, you can use the React Native Debugger frontend to inspect and debug your React Native app. First, serve the built files 
locally using:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory out/Default/gen/front_end
```
Then, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/inspector.html for general debugging, or http://localhost:8000/rn_inspector.html for 
React Native-specific debugging. This allows you to inspect UI components, monitor network requests, and analyze performance metrics directly in 
your browser using Chrome DevTools.

## Development

### Initial setup

1. Install [`depot_tools`](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up) (ensuring your `PATH` is updated).

2. This repository must be located inside a gclient workspace directory. Run the `setup.sh` script to perform this one-time step (which will relocate the repo folder).

    ```sh
    # Using `source` will enable the script to change dir in your shell
    source setup.sh
    ```

### Build-and-run options

1. Build continuously with a file watcher:

   This option continuously rebuilds the project whenever a file changes. It's best suited for active development as it allows you to see changes
   in real time, but it can consume more system resources, especially in larger projects. Use this during iterative work when you need fast
   feedback.

    ```sh
    npm run watch
    ```

1. Build with the default config once:

   This single, non-watched build compiles the project with the default configuration. It’s quicker and less resource-heavy than the watch build,
   making it ideal for testing changes without long-term commitment to resource usage.

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

1. Build with the release config once:

   This one-time build optimizes the code for production use. It’s slower to compile and can take significantly more time but results in a stable,
   high-performance version suitable for production environments. Use this when preparing the project for final deployment or release.

    ```sh
    npm run build-release
    ```

This can then be served from a static web server to test locally:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory out/Default/gen/front_end
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8000/inspector.html` (or `http://localhost:8000/rn_inspector.html` for the RN-specific entry point).

### Syncing with the upstream repo

Periodically, we will sync this project with the upstream [ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend) repo. We always update our fork from a stable upstream branch.

#### Viewing the last synced version

```sh
git tag --merged <branch>
```

#### Performing a repo sync

1. (One-time prerequisite) Add a Git remote pointing to [ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend).

    ```sh
    git remote add chromedevtools git@github.com:ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend.git
    ```

    > Note: The `chromedevtools` naming is optional — `upstream` will typically be set already when originally cloning your local repo with `gh repo clone`.

2. Merge with the target `chromedevtools` branch, then resolve all conflicts(!).

    ```sh
    git switch -c repo-sync # Create a new branch for the repo sync PR
    git rebase upstream/main # Ensure your local branch is up-to-date
    git fetch --all
    git merge chromedevtools/chromium/5845
    ```

3. Submit and merge your PR.
4. Tag the merge commit! This marks the point at which we synced the repo with the upstream branch.

    ```sh
    git tag sync-chromium-5845
    ```
